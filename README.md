# Industrial Organization Economics Simulation Suite

A comprehensive interactive simulation platform for exploring key concepts in Industrial Organization Economics. This project provides hands-on analysis tools for market structures, competition models, game theory, product differentiation, auction mechanisms, and network effects.

## üéØ Features

### 1. Market Structure Analysis
- **Perfect Competition**: Analyze efficient market outcomes with price-taking behavior
- **Monopoly**: Explore market power, deadweight loss, and welfare implications
- **Oligopoly**: Cournot competition with multiple firms
- **Monopolistic Competition**: Differentiated products with free entry

### 2. Price Competition Models
- **Bertrand Competition**: Price competition with product differentiation
- **Cournot Competition**: Quantity competition with strategic interaction
- **Stackelberg Competition**: Sequential move advantage in quantity setting

### 3. Game Theory Applications
- **Prisoner's Dilemma**: Classic cooperation vs. defection analysis
- **Entry Games**: Strategic market entry decisions
- **Pricing Games**: Coordination problems in price setting
- **Investment Games**: Decision-making under uncertainty

### 4. Product Differentiation
- **Hotelling's Linear City**: Spatial competition and location choice
- **Circular City Model**: Competition around a circle (Salop model)
- **Vertical Differentiation**: Quality competition and market segmentation

### 5. Auction Theory
- **First-Price Sealed-Bid**: Strategic bidding below valuation
- **Second-Price Sealed-Bid**: Truth-telling Vickrey auctions
- **English Auctions**: Ascending price mechanisms
- **Dutch Auctions**: Descending price mechanisms

### 6. Network Effects
- **Platform Competition**: Two-sided markets with network externalities
- **Adoption Dynamics**: Critical mass and tipping points
- **Network Externalities**: Welfare analysis of network goods
